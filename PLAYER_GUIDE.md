# Safe by Design
## Player Guide

---

## Welcome

You are the leadership team of a maternity unit. Over six cycles, you'll make decisions that affect patient safety, access to care, staff wellbeing, and system resilience.

There are no perfect answers. Every decision involves trade-offs. Your goal is to build a sustainable, safe maternity service while responding to the challenges that arise.

## How the Game Works

### The Cycle Structure

Each game consists of **6 cycles**. Each cycle follows the same pattern:

1. **Briefing** - You receive information about the current situation, including any events affecting your unit
2. **Decisions** - Your team selects interventions using your available budget
3. **Results** - See how your decisions impacted the four pillars and your metrics
4. **Debrief** - Discuss what happened and why with the facilitator

### Your Budget

Each cycle you have three types of resources to spend:

| Resource | What It Represents |
|----------|-------------------|
| ⚡ **Capacity** | Time, appointments, clinical hours |
| 👥 **Staff Energy** | Workforce attention, morale impact |
| 💷 **Cash** | Financial investment |

Each resource starts at **10 points per cycle**. Unused budget does NOT carry over.

```

- **Cost badges** show resource requirements
- **Effect tags** show which pillars are impacted
- **Timing** shows when effects occur:
  - ⚡ **Now** - Immediate impact this cycle
  - 🕐 **Later** - Delayed impact (1-2 cycles)
  - ⚡🕐 **Both** - Some immediate, some delayed

### Selection Tips

- Click a tile to **select** it (highlighted border)
- Click again to **deselect**
- Watch your **remaining budget** in the left panel
- Greyed-out tiles mean you **can't afford** them
- You can submit with **no decisions** if you choose

## System Status

The left panel shows your current metrics:

| Metric | Good | Warning | Critical |
|--------|------|---------|----------|
| **Backlog** | < 30 | 30-50 | > 50 |
| **DNA Rate** | < 8% | 8-12% | > 12% |
| **Staff Sickness** | < 10% | 10-18% | > 18% |
| **Staff Morale** | > 70% | 50-70% | < 50% |
| **High-Risk Share** | < 25% | 25-35% | > 35% |

**Incidents** from the previous cycle are also shown - these are serious events that occurred.

---

## Random Events

At the start of most cycles, **events** may occur that affect your situation:

### Event Types

| Severity | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| ℹ️ **Info** | Positive news, successful initiatives |
| ⚠️ **Warning** | Challenges requiring attention |
| 🚨 **Critical** | Serious issues with major impact |

### Example Events

- **"Winter Flu Outbreak"** → Staff sickness +8%, capacity reduced
- **"Neighbouring Trust Diverts Patients"** → 20% more referrals
- **"CQC Inspection Announced"** → Must prioritise compliance
- **"Senior Midwife Resignation"** → Experience loss

Events are **outside your control** but you must respond to them with your decisions.

## The Leaderboard

You can see how your team compares to others:

- 🥇🥈🥉 indicate 1st, 2nd, 3rd place
- **Arrows** show if you've moved up or down
- **Score changes** show points gained/lost

The leaderboard updates after each cycle's results.

---

## Strategy Tips

### Early Cycles (1-2)
- Establish your **baseline** - understand starting metrics
- **Invest in foundations** - training and governance pay off later
- Don't overspend on one pillar at the expense of others

### Mid Cycles (3-4)
- **Respond to patterns** - what's working, what's not?
- Watch for **compounding problems** - small issues grow
- **Balance short and long term** - immediate fixes vs sustainability

### Late Cycles (5-6)
- **Address your weaknesses** - what's dragging you down?
- Consider **recovery actions** if something has spiralled
- Think about **sustainability** - could your service continue like this?

### General Advice

1. **No single pillar wins** - balance is important
2. **Staff problems cascade** - tired staff make mistakes and leave
3. **Backlog compounds** - delays create more delays
4. **Invest in prevention** - it's cheaper than crisis response
5. **Read the events** - they give clues about what to prioritise
6. **Discuss as a team** - different perspectives help

---

## Discussion Questions

During debrief, consider:

- What trade-offs did we make? Were they the right ones?
- What surprised us about the results?
- Where did a small decision have a big impact?
- What would we do differently if we played again?
- How does this mirror real-world challenges?
